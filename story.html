<p>In a magical hidden world beneath the depths of the vast ocean, there is a wide garden filled with
    shimmering lights and colorful coral reefs. In this garden, the bioluminescent organisms known as
    phytoplankton live. They have mastered the art of illumination and radiance in the darkness and are
    renowned for their ability to produce oxygen and consume a significant amount of carbon dioxide.
    They reside in various habitats, with some living near the surface and others in the depths.
    One day, a new child was born to them, and they named him Kareem. Kareem always wondered what
    lies beyond the ocean. However, his family told him that there exists a world of giant humans outside
    the ocean, about which they knew very little.
    As Kareem grew up, he befriended many marine creatures, and every night, he would gather with his
    tribe for a session of illuminating the ocean. Kareem exclaimed enthusiastically, "Look at how the
    ocean sparkles with our magic, and how beautiful our enchantment spreads." Another young creature
    responded, saying, "But have you noticed how the weather is changing and affecting us and the
    marine life?" Kareem replied, "How does the weather affect us?" The young creature answered, "We are
    accustomed to living in temperatures ranging from 10 to 25 degrees Celsius. Climate change is taking
    a toll on marine organisms, including us." Kareem asked, "Have you noticed the reasons behind such
    changes?" The young creature said, "Currently, it remains a mystery, and I am studying it. Would you
    like to join me in researching it?" Kareem eagerly replied, "Certainly!"
    The young creature introduced himself as Najib, and Kareem introduced himself as well. They grew
    closer as friends, especially since both were interested in studying the causes of climate change and
    temperature fluctuations. Days went by, and Kareem and Najib spent a lot of time together, becoming
    very close friends. They were determined to find a solution to the changing climate.
    One day, when Kareem went to meet Najib at their usual spot, he found Najib looking different than
    usual. Concerned, Kareem asked, "What's wrong?" Najib replied, "I heard about what happened
    yesterday. The weather was extremely hot, and one of the marine creatures couldn't tolerate it and
    deteriorated, eventually dying." Kareem felt saddened by Najib's words and said, "Don't lose hope,
    Najib. We have been studying for a long time, and we will find a solution." He placed his hand on his
    friend's shoulder to console him.
    Days passed, and the situation continued to worsen. They carried out their bioluminescent activities
    during the day and held sessions of illuminating the ocean at night. One day, a sudden weather
    upheaval occurred, and it was one of the hottest days they had experienced. Kareem and his family
    suffered from severe heatstroke. On the second day, when Kareem regained his strength, he went to
    meet Najib at their usual spot but couldn't find him. When he asked about Najib from his tribe, he
    learned that Najib had fallen severely ill and passed away.
    Kareem was deeply devastated. His lifelong friend had passed away. Kareem became despondent,
    and every day, as he passed by their meeting spot, he would remember Najib and visit his grave,
    promising him that he would fulfill their dream of discovering the causes behind the weather
    fluctuations.
    True to his word, Kareem devoted all his time to studying. Days went by, and finally, he smiled and
    said, "Finally, I know the reason." He went to Najib's grave and began speaking, "We were always
    searching for external reasons, but we never thought about our own contribution. My dear friend, I
    have discovered that the decrease in oxygen levels in the atmosphere and the increase in carbon
    dioxide, known as greenhouse gas emissions, are causing global warming and extreme temperatures."
    He then went to his tribe during their daily sessions and explained to them how they absorb significant
    amounts of carbon dioxide and produce larger quantities of oxygen to overcome climate change. And
    there he stood, fulfilling his duty with a smile on his face.

<p>Once upon a time, in a small village located on the ocean coast, there were two sisters who enjoyed the beauty and tranquility of the ocean.
     The younger sister would sing to the ocean:
     oh ocean so vast and deep , your secrets you always keep , with your ebb and flow you captivate my soul .
     Suddenly, the ocean transformed into a strange man who appeared to be a superhero. He carried a large bag filled with various marine creatures such as fish, whales, algae, and others. He also had a magical tool that illuminated and glowed with a beautiful green color.

Curious, the sisters approached him and asked how he became a superhero when he was just a vast body of water where we see fish and whales. He replied, "I perform important functions that many humans overlook." They then asked about the magical tool in his hand. He explained that it contained one of the most important organisms called phytoplankton. These single-celled organisms resemble plants and carry out photosynthesis, producing essential nutrients such as oils and proteins that serve as food for marine organisms.

The sisters were amazed by phytoplankton's role and before they could ask their next question, the ocean informed them that phytoplankton also absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is of great importance to planet Earth because carbon dioxide is one of the most significant greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.

The younger sister asked if humans have any role in causing its increase. The ocean replied affirmatively, mentioning deforestation and increased burning of fossil fuels as examples. It further explained how each plankton organism absorbs 0.1 grams of carbon dioxide, resulting in an overall absorption level of 100 grams.

To put this into perspective, using a car for a short trip to the grocery store is an excellent example. Assuming an average fuel consumption rate of 10 kilometers per liter of gasoline and a round trip distance of 5 kilometers from home to the store, calculations show that each liter emits 2.3 kilograms of carbon dioxide â€“ far more than what can be absorbed.

The older sister concluded, "If we can redistribute greenhouse gas emissions, use renewable energy extensively worldwide, and address pollution, we have a chance to mitigate the effects of global warming and save the environment." The sisters began raising awareness among the village residents about the importance of preserving the ocean. They organized lectures and workshops to explain the effects of pollution and climate change, as well as how everyone can contribute to environmental protection.

During beach trips, everyone cleaned up the shores and removed pollution. These experiences demonstrated to everyone the importance of maintaining cleanliness in the ocean and its impact on ecological balance. The ocean truly became a superhero with numerous benefits and a source of inspiration for all.
